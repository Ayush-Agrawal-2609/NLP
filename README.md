Sentiment Analysis Project


Here we have a dataset containing comments and ratings of them depending on it is a positive or a negative statement this dataset is sent as an argument through a function called clean all and it returns the dataset in normal form after cleaning everything.
After that, we used KNeighborsClassifier() for prediction and gained 81% accuracy.
Later we also checked the model by sending a text which gave the output 0 (representing a negative sentence).
